# localExplorer

Serve files in a better way.

It is under development but try it now:

```bash
$ npm i -g git://github.com/darkowlzz/localExplorer
```

Then do:

```bash
$ localExplorer /absolute/path/to/file
```

Use path to directories containing mp3 files at the moment.
Example:
```bash
$ localExplorer /Users/username/Music
```

Visit localhost:3000/app/ to see it working :)
